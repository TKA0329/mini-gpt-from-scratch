Prompt: Hello.
Hello. If you like, just now, how I'm in my heart!" Though he had begun to dream, 
he had run away and had begun to sit in a state of horror. "That creature would do 
something in me?" He walked downstairs, the familiar old gentleman who had 
entered on his journey, always to see something of that sort, looking on at Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch,
who bowed in a chair. His daughter had seen him in the dining-room dressing-room in which 
she had taken part with his daughter." He was quite disconcerted in the visit. 
Liza smiled with tears in her eyes. "I won't have anything to say. 
It was a little, I didn't like asking for a long time to answer a question. 
I thought I wasn't married by you in that way. But you're not the child from her. 
I was simply speaking..." Shatov hesitated. "So you've long been so irritable, 
Pyotr Stepanovitch," Nikolay Vsyevolodovitch whispered with a loud voice, in the air. 
"But you thought of Shatov himself? Good heavens, if you'd never seen him, 
you'd be glad to have turned out every way. He isn't lying." 

Prompt: She looked at him with trembling hands
She looked at him with trembling hands, she said to him, with her eyes wide open, 
and he smiled away at her. He had his fingers put on her cheek, and not letting his heart drop. 
A sudden feeling he took on her for a moment the sight he had spoken, his face looked 
inquiringly at her. For a long time he hardly knew or not. But what had led a change to it! 
He looked round, he met her as though he were trying to look round at her. 
“No, wait a minute, stay a minute, please,” she thought, for something on the whole 
earth began to cry out aloud. But she was too much upset. She looked at him with 
flashing eyes—fixed up to her with the same strange expression, as she did so herself.
